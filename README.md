   - **What I Learned**:  
     - Automating tests using Unit Testing and Instrumentation Testing.  
     - Ensuring app stability and functionality through test-driven development practices.  

### 8. **Local Data Persistent**  
   - **Duration**: 26 hours  
   - **What I Learned**:  
     - Exploring different ways to store data in Android, such as:  
       - File Storage  
       - `DataStore`  
       - `Room` database  
     - Implementing a local database to save and retrieve favorite data efficiently.  

### 9. **Background Task dan Scheduler**  
   - **Duration**: 11 hours 50 minutes  
   - **What I Learned**:  
     - Running background tasks using components like:  
       - `AlarmManager`  
       - `WorkManager`  
     - Scheduling and managing tasks for better app performance.  

## üéØ Final Project  
The course culminated in a **Submission Project**, where I created an application that:  
- Fetches data from a Web API.  
- Saves favorite data locally using a `Room` database.  

This project tested my ability to integrate various concepts learned throughout the course into a cohesive and functional application.  

## üí° Experience and Reflections  
This course was an enriching experience that expanded my understanding of Android development. It provided a hands-on approach to learning, with real-world case studies that bridged theory and practice seamlessly.  

The final project challenged me to synthesize the concepts and tools I learned, helping me improve my problem-solving skills and gain confidence in building complete Android applications.  

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Gratitude  
I am deeply grateful for the well-structured content, guidance from the instructors, and support from the community that made this learning journey enjoyable and fulfilling.  

## üöÄ Next Steps  
Having completed this course, I am eager to explore advanced topics in Android development, such as Jetpack Compose and Kotlin Coroutines. I am excited to build innovative apps that deliver value to users.
